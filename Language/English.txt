Help Topic: Name and Path Column Widths

The first number sets the width of the name column (first column) in Details view.

The second number Sets the width of any path columns enabled in Details view.

The value is specified in ems. 1 em ≈ 1 char

Em size is relative to screen scaling. For example (at 96 dpi):

1 em at 100% = 8 pixels
1 em at 125% = 10 pixels
1 em at 150% = 12 pixels

Explorer uses ems internally for all its default column widths. This keeps the amount of text displayed in each column constant as screen scaling is changed.
